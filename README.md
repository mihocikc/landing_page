Landing Page CSS Excerise

Honestly, I really struggled in the beginning. I think I glossed over the flexbox lessons and it really hurt me when trying to jump into the project. 
So, I stepped away for a few days and dove back into flex models and CSS to really learn how to make the items fit together correctly. 
It definitely got easier as I went down the page. The Header and Hero were the hardest part, and I'm still not convinced I have it in the spot where I want it, but I believe that the details will come with more exercises and practice. 

Thanks for reading so far if you're here.
